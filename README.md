TinyBiz
=======

TinyBiz comes from the mind of puertorican students Erick Caraballo and Wesley Martinez. The project was endorsed 
for the purpose of helping small merchants in the island of Puerto Rico. The page allows owners to create a profile of
their store this include: information about the store, image of the store, location, owner name, etc. 
The user will be able to upload a menu (if it is a restaurant), one of the special features of the page is the 'specials'
tab, this lets the owner upload weekly or daily specials, those specials will appear on the home page.  Users will be able
to leave feedback (comments, like and dislike buttons) of the store. A google map is available in each profile, within it 
a pin point location of the store. 

Feel free to take a look...
